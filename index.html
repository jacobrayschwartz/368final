	<h2>About Me:</h2>
	<p>
		I am a Computer Science major at EWU. I have lived in Spokane for most of my life, though I have also lived overseas in both Suriname in South America, and China, at a young age. I developed a love for the culture (and food, especially the food) and I would really love to go back some day. <br>
		My career goal is to go into software engineering, hopefully being able to travel all over the world.<br>
		My interests include music, both listening to and playing, computers (obviously), and occasionally a good book.
